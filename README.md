# Pre update notice
We are currently in the process of updating and releasing new sets of crosswalks. Documentations will be added in the coming weeks. For the time being, the previous release crosswalk (onetnoc.csv) has been renamed noc2016_onet20.csv And the description of the file remains the same.
# NOC to O*Net Crosswalk
To learn more about what we did: visit this blog (currently unpublished)
This repository currently contains 1 CSV file, with 1038 rows (1039 with the headers) It has the following columns:
*  **noc**: NOC-4 Codes
*  **noc_title**: Title of the NOC Occupation
*  **onet** O\*Net code
*  **onet_title** Title of the O\*Net Occupation


# Methodology
We crosswalked the NOC to O*Netusing a two-stage process. First, we leveraged the existing crosswalks between NOC and ISCO (International Standard Classification of Occupations) and between ISCO and O*Net. From this base-level matching, we manually went through the results and adjusted these matchings, primarily through using job titles associated with each occupational groups. Most importantly, we followed the principle that every NOC occupation has to have at least one matching O*Net occupation. As weâ€™re interested in Canadian occupations, this allows us to make sure we have all Canadian occupations categorized.
